    "# Capstone Project: Final Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we look at predicting the outcome of a soccer game from the five major European leagues in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Our client is a betting agency who is looking into improving its predictive power to better produce odds for the games. Our benchmark is the average correctness of the major betting agencies accepting bets on European soccer. As odds are inversely proportional to the probability of a certain outcome (Home win, Draw, or Away win) lower odds correspond to higher probability of a given outcome. By selecting the lowest odds as the betting agency prediction, we will measure their prediction accuracy against the actual outcome of a game. Our goal here is to produce a prediction model that does better than the average consensus of the agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leagues selected and the computed betting agencies correctness in each are shown in the graph below. The overall correctness is 53.25%, while in the 5 major leagues the accuracy is 53.02%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from the Soccer Database at https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer on the Kaggle website. This database is actually a collection of data from different sources:\n",
    "1. http://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com/ : scores, lineup, team formation and events\n",
    "\n",
    "2. http://www.football-data.co.uk/ : betting odds. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. http://sofifa.com/ : players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games\n",
    "\n",
    "The database consists of 4 different tables; *Player*, *Player_Attributes*, *Team*, and *Match*. The Player table includes name, birthdate, height and weight of the player associated with a particular player_id. The Team table contains the full and short (3 letters) names of a team. The Player_Attributes comes from the EA Sports Fifa game and includes several characteristics: overall ranking, preferred foot, goal keeping abilities, shooting abilities, offensive and defensive rankings, and others for a total of about 40. Finally, the Match team contains all details of games played starting with the 2008/09 season and up to the 2015/2016 season. It contains the teams involved, the goals scored, the team formations, the teams' starting 11, major games' events, and betting odds from several betting agencies for a total of 115 variables. Most of the information relating to the events happened during a game, such as free-kicks awarded, shots on goal, or scoring players' names, is contained within a few columns in HTML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the data is clean, there are only a few missing values, corresponding to a few games in the Italian Serie A during the 2010/11 season. In addition the betting odds were not collected for two of the leagues: Poland Ekstraklasa and Switzerland Super League. These leagues will be excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Our preliminary analysis of the data will look into five different areas; Upsets, Home Advantage, Stage Effect, Team Performance, and Goals Scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upsets\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to better understand how the betting agencies are doing in predicting outcomes for different leagues and different outcomes. The following graph shows how the betting agencies consensus is faring in each league, for which betting odds are avaialable. \n",
    "\n",
    "![League Correctness](league_correctness.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few interesting things stand out from the above bar chart. First of all booking agencies almost never predict a draw for games. This basically means that they are ok with being wrong roughly one fourth of the times, as 25.3% of all games actually end in a draw. Of all games only 31 were 'expected' to more likely be a draw, 28 in the Italian league and 3 in the French league. This is something to consider if one wants to improve on the booking agencies overall correctness rate, computed at 53.2%. It is important here to specify that betting agencies have several ways to 'hedge' against such predictions which are reflected in the odds offered on the games. In other words, while they might favor a result over another their overall odds strategy will offset such problems, as the odds' difference will be small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another observation is that generally agencies do a better job of predicting a home win rather than an away win. The only exceptions are the Scottish league, where the opposite is true, and the Portuguese league where the difference is minimal. Comparison with predictions of draw should not be done given the really low number of such cases. Predicting a home win seems, intuitively, easier than an away win, especially when the difference between two teams is high. We will return to this point a little bit later to confirm our intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more from this graph we zoom in on the results and display horizontal lines at the values of the average predictions across all leagues (by predicted outcome of a game). In this graph we drop the draw category, due to the low amount of games and reliability of related statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "![League Correctness Zoom](league_correctness_zoom.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see the agencies seem to do better on certain leagues. The Spanish and the Portuguese leagues are both predicted correctly above average for both Home and Away wins. Other leagues have differing outcomes, given Home or Away. It is easier than average to predict a home win, and worse than average to predict an away win in; Belgium, England, Italy and the Netherlands, while the opposite is true for Scotland. The hardest leagues to predict are the French and German leagues where betting agencies do worse than average in both home and away wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek here confirmation of the intuition that home teams have what is usually referred to as home advantage, that is: home teams win more often than away teams. We look at the value of the difference between home and away wins' percentages, and goals scored, for teams in all leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Home Advantage and Goals](home_adv_goals.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be a clear home advantage as home teams score almost half a goal extra compared to away teams. In addition home teams win about 46% of all games while away teams only win about 29% of all games. The remaining 25%, as stated earlier, ends in a draw. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also looked at whether there is any relation between this result and how predictable a league is. To do this we first computed a weighted average for correctness of predictions, including all predictions: Home, Draw, and Away, and then looked at whether there is any correlation when using the above 'home advantage' values to explain league predictability. Dropping, once again, the Polish and Swiss leagues as we don't have betting odds for them. The Pearson test seemed to show that there is indeed a positive linear correlation between these variables, as the Pearson's correlation coefficient is r=.60 and the p-value=0.09. Looking at the graph below we see that the value for Scotland is somewhat of an outlier, indeed once Scotland is removed the new values are: r=.45 and p-value=.27.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Regression Line](reg_line_win_diff_league_pred.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value, in both tests, is too high to be able to state that the positive correlation observed is not due to randomness in the data. Nevertheless, the p-values might be high due to the few data points available. Having previously noticed that home wins are predicted correctly more than away wins we can still say that it seems to be somewhat easier to predict games when the home advantage is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there any difference in home wins percentage by stage number? That is: is it easier to win home games early, or late, in the season, or is there any difference at all? To answer such questions we limit ourselves to the 5 major European leagues: England Premiere League, France Ligue 1, Germany Bundesliga, Italy Serie A and Spain Liga BBVA. Although we group our data by stage number we still have about 80 games per stage number per league, so that our results will be somewhat *robust*. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Home Wins by Stage](home_wins_by_stage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top graph displaying the home win percentage by stage does not reveal anything unusual, results seem to hover around the average for all stages, which for the top 5 leagues is 46.27%. The second graph looks at the (absolute) difference with the average in each league, and while showing some peaks again does not seem to show that there is any meaningful difference.\n",
    "The variation among single stages is too high for us to pick up any meaningful difference, so we try to group stages and display the average of N consecutive stages, with N a parameter we set equal to 5, corresponding for most leagues to about a month of games. We also separate the plots and display the individual country average home win percentage. Results are shown in the following graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Home Wins by Stage](home_wins_by_stage_N5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All graphs use the same axes limits so that it is easier to see any anomalies. It looks like the graph for France Ligue 1 doesn't display any pattern, while those for the other leagues do. In England and Germany home field advantage seems to be more important towards the end of the season, while in Italy the opposite is true. Finally, in Spain the best time to play at home is the middle of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting observation is that generally home field advantage is less important through the first few games, as all graphs above are at or below their averages. We recall that the first point in each graph, at the 0 mark, correspond to the average of the first N=5 games, while the last corresponds to the average of the last 5 games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "A look at individual teams performance in terms of winning percentage. The top 50 teams, and the bottom 15, in terms of winning percentage are labeled on the graph.\n",
    "![Tean Win Percentage](team_win_percentage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, the two big Spanish juggernauts Barcelona and Real Madrid come out on top of this special ranking. Several less known teams appear in this ranking as well, given that all the games in question are played within each country league. Thus we see close to the top; Celtic and Rangers (Scotland), RSC Anderlecht and Club Brugge KV (Belgium), FC Basel (Switzerland), and Legia Warszawa and Lech Poznan (Poland). All these teams can be considered juggernauts in their domestic leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a further consideration we now have a better idea about why the Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese leagues turned out to be the three most predictable leagues, with respectively 56.2%, 55.8%, and 54.8% of results predicted correctly. Each of these leagues has two teams in the top 9. An anomaly seems to be Scotland again. Although Celtic and Rangers are right after the two Spanish juggernauts Barcelona and Real Madrid and the the two top Portuguese teams Benfica and Porto, the league overall is the least predictable with the exception of the French league. This is probably a consequence of the fact that the next most winning team sits well below the two top teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting thing that stands out from this graph is how the first two teams in Spain, Portugal and Scotland are well separated from the rest, a fact that only applies to another team: Bayern Munich from Germany. Such a dominance is not seen in other leagues. In particular we see that France has seen no dominating team (during those years) and this has probably contributed to making the French league a little less predictable with only 50.51% correctly predicted outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The game of soccer is all about scoring one more goal than the opponent, so we conclude with a look at how many goals are scored per game. The following graph shows histogram of the distribution of goals scored per game for each of the 5 major leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Goals Histogram](goals_hist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All the distribution are right skewed, but in general seem to look roughly bell-shaped. No differences are apparent from these graphs, besides that in some leagues, like Germany and Spain, slightly more high scoring games are played."

    "## The approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to improve on predicting outcomes for the games we will build onto the work done by the betting agencies and therefore use the *consensus* odds for Home Win, Draw, and Away Win for the first three features. These odds were collected exactly 48 hours before the start of the games. Not all the betting agencies offered odds on all the games, so the average is calculated on *up to* 10 betting agencies.\n",
    " * **avgH**: average odds for Home win for up to 10 betting agencies\n",
    " * **avgD**: average odds for Home win for up to 10 betting agencies\n",
    " * **avgA**: average odds for Home win for up to 10 betting agencies\n",
    "\n",
    "A second set of features tries to account for the overall strength of a team, in terms of average points during the current season. Points are awarded as: 3 for a win, 1 for a tie, 0 for a loss.\n",
    " * **points_home**: the average points by a team up to the previous game in the current season \n",
    " * **points_away**: the average points by a team up to the previous game in the current season \n",
    "\n",
    "A third set of features accounts for whether a team is hot or cold, by looking at the average points over the last 5 games. Notice that if a team has played less than 5 games the average will be out of only the games played that far. \n",
    " * **streak_home**: the average points by a team up to the previous game in the current season for up to the last 5 games\n",
    " * **streak_away**: the average points by a team up to the previous game in the current season for up to the last 5 games\n",
    "\n",
    "A fourth set of features is given by the actual formation type used by the teams. For example a team could play with a 4-3-3, that is: with 4 defenders, 3 midfielders, and 3 forwards. As the number of possible starting formations in the dataset are more than 20, this would create about 40 binary features. We, instead, summarize these findings into two features: one determining whether a team is offensive or not, and one for whether it is defensive or not. As an example: a 5-3-2 formation type is determined to be defensive as it includes 5 defenders, while a 3-4-3 formation is deemed to be offensive as it uses 3 forwards, and only 3 defenders.\n",
    " * **defensive_home**: binary variable determining whether the home team starting 11 is defensive (1) or not (0)\n",
    " * **defensive_away**: binary variable determining whether the home team starting 11 is defensive (1) or not (0)\n",
    " * **offensive_home**: binary variable determining whether the home team starting 11 is offensive (1) or not (0)\n",
    " * **offensive_away**: binary variable determining whether the home team starting 11 is offensive (1) or not (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "More features are added by looking at the value of the attributes of the field players, given in the Player Stats table. The field players are all the players, except the goalkeeper. Their attributes' values are averaged over the home and away teams. In addition the goal keepers attributes are added as well, for both teams. Missing values in the team data are simply ignored, that is: the averages are computed only on the available players. Goal keepers missing data is replaced with the average value of that attribute among all existing data. In total this produces 30 team and 5 goal keeper features for each team, adding 70 features total. All values are integers between 0 and 100. A few examples are shown below:\n",
    " * **overall_rating_home**: average overall rating of players of the home team\n",
    " * **heading_accuracy_home**: average accuracy with headers of players of the home team\n",
    " * **stamina_home**: average player's ability to run for the entire game for players of the home team\n",
    " * **vision_home**: average player's ability to foresee the course of an action for players of the home team\n",
    " * **gk_diving_home**: home team goal keeper's ability to dive to stop a ball\n",
    " * **gk_reflexes_home**: home team goal keeper's reflexes evaluation\n",
    " * **...**\n",
    "\n",
    "As games are often decided by the presence of a single good player, another feature introduced is the overall_rating of the best player in the team.\n",
    " * **best_player_home**: highest overall rating of players of the home team\n",
    " * **best_player_away**: highest overall rating of players of the away team\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring the actual predictions of the model, we noted that the model never predicted a Draw, but only Home wins and Away wins. This is not too different from what the betting agencies do. Only in 34 instances out of more than 14,500 games under consideration the betting agencies favored a Draw. This is somewhat surprising as more than a fourth of all games end with a Draw. In order to *force* the model to predict more draws we used the class_weight option of the LogisticRegression classifier of sklearn. While this forced the model to make some Draw predictions, it did not improve on the accuracy of the model. A different approach was then taken to add two more features to characterize games that are more likely to end in a draw. \n",
    " * **diff**: the difference between highest and lowest value of odds consensus\n",
    " * **tie**: a score from 0 to 5 based on whether a match satisfies, or not, 5 criterias more likely to identify tie games\n",
    "\n",
    "The *diff* feature should help the classifier identify games likely to end in a tie. The assumption is that those are the games where the odds difference among the various predicted results is small. The *tie* feature is based on a set of criterias most likely to identify games whose outcome was a tie. The number of criterias chosen is 5, and these are automatically identified from the given features. Games were separated based on whether the actual outcome was a tie, or not a tie. The averages for all features are then computed on both sets and compared to determine which features produce the greatest normalized difference. Games are then scored based by counting for how many of these features their values are beyond a fixed number of standard deviations from the mean. In the final run of the chosen classifier these were: \n",
    " * *diff*, *avgD*, *avgA*, *best_player_home*, *overall_rating_home*\n",
    " \n",
    "The classifiers considered were scored using the median accuracy score over 10 runs of the algorithm using different training and test sets. An analysis of the correlation matrix showed that the features from the player stats table were higly correlated among each others. It was decided to use only two of them: *best_player* and *overall_rating*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Various classifiers were tested for accuracy, in particular Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ADABoost using Random Forest. They all produced very similar results around 52.5%-52.8% accuracy. Using the Random Forest Classifier that obtained an accuracy score of 52.66% produced the confusion matrix below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Confusion Matrix](confusion_matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, most predictions are for Home Win but only a few more than half are correct. This is similar to what bookies do, most of their predictions are for home win. What is important for bookies though is that the probabilities assigned to each outcome are correct. To test the generated probabilities we run CalibratedClassifierCV, prefit on the Random Forest classifier chosen earlier. We then compare the uncalibrated and the calibrated classifiers by means of a calibration plot. This is a plot that groups together samples that were assigned a similar probability by the classifier, say *p*, and tests whether they indeed happen about *p* percent of the times. The three plots for Away win, Draw, and Home win are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Away Win calibration Plot](away_cali_compare.png)\n",
    "![Draw calibration Plot](draw_cali_compare.png)\n",
    "![Home Win calibration Plot](home_cali_compare.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibrated Random Forest Classifier indeed seems to improve slightly the probability calibration of the classifier. In both cases, though, the classifiers seem to be well calibrated. We compare them to the calibration plots of the bookmakers shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Away Win bookies calibration Plot](away_cali_bookie.png)\n",
    "![Draw bookies calibration Plot](draw_cali_bookie.png)\n",
    "![Home Win bookies calibration Plot](home_cali_bookie.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we see how Logistic Regression does at correctly calibrating probabilities.\n",

    "## Testing the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration plots give us a good feeling about how the classifiers are doing but we can actually compute the ROI, Return On Investment, of such models for a bookmaker. In order to perform the comparison fairly we modify the odds suggested by a model, to introduce a bookmaker's commission. We set this, on average, equal to the average commission computed on the bookmaker's odds, which is 6.52%. We also make the assumption that the odds, whether from the model or the bookmaker are balanced. That is: they are set, so that an equal amount of money is spent on each of the outcomes. This is clearly a simplification, so that the actual ROI values might not apply to a real-life situation, where bets will be most likely unbalanced. On the other hand, the ROI values will still be significant for a comparison between models. We show first how the Logistic Regression model performed, when compared to the bookmaker's odds, which have a ROI of 24.2% on the entire data set. As seen in the graph below it scored a ROI of 20.1%, slightly worse than the bookmaker's model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Linear Regression ROI](lr_ROI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibrated Linear Regression Classifier actually did not improve the ROI, it actually lowered it to 18.6%. A similar situation happened with the Random Forest classifier, where the calibrated version of it reduced the ROI by about 2.5% as well. Nevertheless this classifier clearly outperformed Logistic Regression and the bookmaker's model as it produced a ROI of about 39%. Given to the inherent randomness introduced in Random Forest by only choosing a (random) subset of features to be used when building the forest trees at each step, such results vary slightly on different runs.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we were tasked with building a Machine Learning model that would improve on the accuracy of the bookmaker's odds, when it comes to predicting the final outcome of a soccer match in the 5 major European Leagues. While, strictly in terms of accuracy we came a little short, as our best model had an accuracy of 52.81% versus the bookmaker's accuracy of 53.02%, we were able to produce a model that improves on the probabilities assigned to the possible outcomes of a match. Indeed, in a situation of balanced odds it will actually have a much higher ROI over the bookmaker's own model, as tested on the provided data set."
